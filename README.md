# Homework2

* I use the Bootstrap CSS Framework to create a mobile responsive portfolio, and develop my portfolio site with the following items:

   * A navbar is consistent on each page & contains links to Home/About, Contact, and Portfolio pages

   * A responsive layout

   * Responsive images

   The app contains my personalized information. (bio, name, images, links to social media, etc.)

* The Bootstrap portfolio should minimize the use of media queries.

* On an `xs` screen, content should take up the entire screen. 
  On `sm` and larger screens, we should have some margins on the left and right sides of the screen. 

*I Use an HTML validation service to ensure that each page has valid HTML.
